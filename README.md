# GraalVM Examples

A collection of examples and use-cases for the GraalVM.

* [Weather Predictor](./weather_predictor/README.md) is an application that performs temperature prediction using Ruby, R and Node.js.
* [FastR Java UI](./fastr_javaui/README.md) is a Java based Swing desktop UI application showing visualization interactively generated by R script.
* [FastR Scalar](./fastr_scalar/README.md) is a simple, straightforward implementation of "Conway's Game of Life" written in R.
* [FastR rJava](./fastr_rJava/README.md) is a small benchmark script exercising rJava functionality.
* [Node.js & FastR](./fastr_node/README.md) is a Node.js web server showing visualization computed and generated in FastR.


## Setup

In order to run the examples, the latest GraalVM must be installed.
It can be downloaded from the [Oracle Technology Network](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/downloads/index.html).
Extract the archive and set the `GRAALVM_DIR` environment variable to point to the graalvm directory.

To build all examples, execute the `build_all.sh` script.

A typical problem is proxy set-up: verify that you have the `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` environment variables set properly.


## Run

To run a single example, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file in the example directory.

To run all tests, execute the `test_all.sh` script.
